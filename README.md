git clone https://github.com/[username]/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming.git

# Navigate to the repository
cd holbertonschool-higher_level_programming

# Run any Python file
python3 [filename].py
```

## 📝 Testing
Each project contains its own tests in either:
- Doctest format (`.txt` files in `tests` directories)
- Unittest format (Python files with `test_` prefix or in `tests` directories)

To run tests:
```bash
# For doctests
python3 -m doctest ./tests/*

# For unittests
python3 -m unittest discover tests
```

## ✨ Features
